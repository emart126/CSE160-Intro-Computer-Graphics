    Notes to Grader
    <p>
        For the awsomeness point I played around with the circle class. I was able to add a new render function that randomizes each color of each triangle within the triangle. I used this to make it look like my drawing has some type of stained glass to the structure in the drawing. Every time the draw picture button gets pressed a new window shows up.
